# CS 9 Review

''' Logistics
* The final exam will be on Gradescope Thursday 6/9 @ 8 - 10AM PST
* The final exam with be cummulative
* It will look similar to Quizzes / homeworks in terms of questions asked,
but will be longer in length
    * True / False
    * Short answers
        * Briefly describe / define / state / ...
    * Write code satisfying a certain specification
    * Write solutions (autograded)
* We will be monitoring Piazza during the final exam time.
    * For CLARIFYING questions, you may post a PRIVATE question to instructors
    * If there needs to be a change/modification in any question, then we will
    publicly post this on Piazza.
